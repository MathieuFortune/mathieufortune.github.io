    "desc": "Active member of the project’s teams I’m linked to, I make the connection between graphic design and front-end development.
            User interface design, leading user tests and coding modern HTML5, SASS/LESS, Javascript of desktop and mobile web applications are my main skills.
            Everyday, I identify, search and resolve problems with a LEAN approach, by working with Agile methods.
            I’m passionate by my job and I love to share it with my co-workers, constantly learning and experiencing new things.
            I’m also an active contributor of meetups and events that allow to share and promote the UX/UI Design and Front-End Development jobs.
