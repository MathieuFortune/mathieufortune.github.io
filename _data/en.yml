intro: |
    With 12 years of experience, I deliver user-centric, intuitive, and accessible digital solutions across Climate Tech, EdTech, E-commerce, and consumer-facing industries. My expertise spans B2C and B2B web apps and SaaS platforms, thriving in startup environments.<br/><br/> As a co-founder, boutique studio owner, and individual contributor, I bring an entrepreneurial mindset and apply agile methodologies to iteratively simplify complex problems. I'm more than just a pixel pusher â€” I'm a strategic partner, building products that delight users and drive business growth.

    With a background in front-end development and close collaboration with marketing teams, I lead projects from concept to launch, translating diverse stakeholder needs into user-centered outcomes. I'm passionate about mentoring junior designers and fostering a collaborative environment that empowers teams to do their best work.<br/><br/> Equally comfortable working independently or within a team, I establish processes that streamline workflows and enhance quality. I'm seeking to contribute my skills to a mission-driven company that leverages design and technology for positive societal and environmental impact.
