intro: |
    I bring 12 years of experience delivering intuitive and accessible digital solutions across Climate Tech, EdTech, E-commerce, and consumer-facing platforms. My expertise spans B2C and B2B web apps and SaaS platforms, thriving in both startup environments—from early-stage to growth-stage companies—and more established organizations.<br/><br/> As a co-founder of a startup, owner of a boutique design studio, and collaborative individual contributor, I offer a broad skill set paired with an entrepreneurial mindset. I'm skilled in applying agile methodologies to iteratively deliver solutions that simplify complex problems.

    With a background in front-end development and experience working closely with marketing teams, I'm more than a pixel pusher—I'm a strategic partner in building products that delight users and drive business growth. I lead projects from concept to launch, translating the needs of diverse stakeholders—including business, legal, marketing, engineering, product, design, and customers—into successful, user-centered outcomes.<br/><br/> I am passionate about mentoring junior designers and collaborating with cross-functional colleagues, fostering a collaborative work environment where everyone can do their best work. I excel at establishing processes and tools that streamline and enhance team workflows, ensuring greater efficiency and improved quality of deliverables. A generalist at heart, I am equally comfortable working autonomously or as part of a team, owning the entire process from research to execution. My ability to communicate effectively with all stakeholders ensures projects are delivered with excellence.<br/><br/>I'm looking to contribute my skills and experience to a mission-driven company that leverages design and technology to create positive societal and environmental impact.
