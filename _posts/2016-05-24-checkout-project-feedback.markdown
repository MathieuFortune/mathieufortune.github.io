## Problem


The first version of 1001pharmacies.com's checkout process has proven that it needed some redesign, from the usability point of view. Based on our collected data, the user's abandon rate and exit rate were high.

## Research


We needed to better understand these datas. We conducted user researches on the checkout process to learn more about their characteristics, needs, desires and to evaluate their perception about 1001pharmacies.com's offer.

We decide to choose our loyal users to find their pain points, so we could fix them and their use of the product.

This research has led us to 2 hypotesis.

First, the shipping cost is a source of questions and they can be too high.
To understand, it's important to know that when a user add differents products in his cart, it can occur that some products are available in multiple sellers, this create multi parcel so the shipping cost is increased.

Second, to make an order the user need to sign up to an account. This generate an obstacle to the purchase.
This is consistent with recent reports showing that a high abandon rate is caused by a mandatory sign up.

## Challenge


Some attempts has already be done to improve offer's comprehension inside checkout process.
An informative message, stock optimization algorithm, ... But even if these made some results, this not answered every problems like sign up to a user account.

Redesigning the checkout process without pausing website activity was mandatory.
In an agile approach to these problems, we decided to deliver continuously with a first minimum viable product for performing a complete purchasing process with minimum functionality required.
To focus our efforts, LEAN methods have also allowed us to establish a clear objective:
A user who is not use to purchase online must simply and confidently made a purchase on our website.

For better fit this methodology, from a design point of view, I decided to follow the Design Thinking method for this project.

## Conclusion

Checkout process redesign is still in development. The second mvp release is online and there is not many work left to totally replace the old version. Analytics datas has already shown an increase of conversion rate and a decrease of abandon rate and multi parcel cases.
