## Missions

This project begun in 2012. I've participated to it for 12 months from the v.0 to the v3.2 as Front-End Developer and Web Designer back up. I worked in collaboration with a Back-End Developer and a lead Web Designer.

Our client created this social network to fullfill needs coming from NGOs. In order to answer as precise as possible these needs, we developped in an iterative mode each module's feature in order to allow them to be tested by our client along the developpement process.

This approach was a challenge for the team because we had to maintain great communication and frequently re-code parts of the project with minimum technical debt.

I bridged the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, by taking an active role on both sides and defining how the social networks looks as well as how it works.

My mission was to propose a multi-langages user interface visually easy to read, easy to understand and pixel perfect.

I was daily:

* Provided interfaces design input and coding out pages from design comps using  interface design pieces (icons, style sheets, etc) using HTML/CSS.
* Participated in user testing to ensure that design applications effectively support business needs.
* Provides website maintenance and enhancements.
* Tested code to identify technical problems.
* Optimized websites for maximum speed and scalability.
* Developed new user-facing features
* Collaborated with other team members and stakeholders
* Developed new user-facing features

I also was led to create from scratched some interfaces, coded them and created all interactions like this one present on the home page :

## Technical specs

This website was powered by a property MVC PHP framework.

I developped both back-end and front-end with pure CSS, HTML5 and jQuery. For the parallax scrolling feature present on the home page, I used SuperScrollRama.js library that allow to manage easily multi DOM elements on scroll event.
