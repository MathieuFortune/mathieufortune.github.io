When I joined Carbon Direct as a Senior Product Designer, I was immediately tasked with addressing a critical challenge: answering the question, "What’s next?" for customers after they received their GHG inventory from our science team. This challenge presented several complexities:

- **Unclear customer profile:** We didn't have a clear understanding of the ideal customer profile for this product area.
- **Uncertain timing:** We were unsure when customers would encounter this problem.
- **Need for speed:** Carbon Direct wanted to make an impact quickly, requiring us to move fast and reassure stakeholders.
- **Complexity of the field:** Carbon management is a highly complex field, and our newly formed team had limited subject matter expertise.
- **Limited resources:** Our team consisted of just a Product Manager, an Engineer, and myself, and expanding the team was contingent on uncovering additional opportunities.

Despite these constraints, addressing our customers' decarbonization needs was a key opportunity for Carbon Direct. The company was already established in the carbon removal market, and our carbon measurement solutions were beginning to take shape. However, we needed a structured approach to tackle this challenge efficiently.

## Leading the Design Sprint

With over a decade of experience in product and design, I saw an opportunity to leverage the Design Sprint process to address the decarbonization needs of our customers. **As the Senior Product Designer, I led, documented and facilitated the sprint**, enabling us to rapidly iterate on the problem and foster creative problem-solving.

For those unfamiliar, a Design Sprint is a structured, five-day process that helps teams solve complex problems and validate ideas quickly. It involves phases like understanding the problem, sketching solutions, deciding on the best approach, prototyping, and testing with users. This approach allows teams to quickly test and refine ideas before committing to full-scale development.

However, after discussions with the Product Manager and Engineer, we realized that our limited knowledge of the problem space and the lack of a clear vision from leadership made it difficult to deliver a functional prototype by the end of the sprint. Instead, we adapted the process to focus on identifying opportunities and involving cross-functional team members early.

**We opted to deliver a suggested roadmap for the decarbonization workstream, along with sketches, rather than a prototype.**

## Collaboration with Cross-Functional Teams

To ensure that all key stakeholders were aligned and their expertise was integrated into the process, I utilized Miro, a collaborative whiteboard tool, to track progress and facilitate meaningful contributions. Over the course of the week, I scheduled live sessions with stakeholders individually and followed up with a group session to review the work and gather feedback.

Our participants included a Product Manager, an Engineer, a Principal Climate Scientist, a Carbon Accountant, an Customer Support Manager, and a Data Analyst. Bringing together these diverse perspectives allowed us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions.

## Adapting the Design Sprint Methodology

Given our unique circumstances, I decided to focus on the first three phases of the traditional Design Sprint—Understand, Sketch, and Decide—while forgoing the prototype and testing phases. This adaptation enabled us to gain a solid understanding of the complex subject matter and identify potential roadmap items for the decarbonization workstream.

One of the key challenges during the sprint was the vast scope of our customers' decarbonization needs. To address this, I gathered existing insights from interview recordings, competitor analyses, and market data within the organization. Collaborating with the Product Manager, we prioritized user pain points for the sprint, specifically aiming to make decarbonization insights more actionable in the platform.

## Outcomes and Impact

The design sprint led to several valuable outcomes:

- **Market positioning:** We identified and visually represented the potential market positioning for Carbon Direct’s solution, providing clarity on how our product fit into the broader landscape.

- **User journeys:** We iteratively developed user journeys that captured the full customer experience throughout their carbon management process, ensuring our solutions addressed needs at every stage.

- **Personas:** We established personas representing both current and projected customer profiles, serving as essential tools for ideation and decision-making.

- **Science Advisor tasks:** We mapped out the various tasks of Science Advisors and conducted interviews to understand their unique challenges and needs when working with customers on decarbonization strategies.

With these foundations, we focused on a specific customer pain point: **making decarbonization insights more actionable within the platform**.

We mapped out user flows for key actors, conducted stakeholder interviews, and distilled feedback into "How Might We" (HMW) statements. These statements were organized into thematic buckets to guide our ideation during the sketching phase.

The ideas generated during the sprint were translated into a comprehensive user flow and wireframes, forming the backbone of the decarbonization roadmap. This roadmap, integrating market research, customer data, expert insights, and business goals, was presented to leadership for feedback and approval.

## Transition and Further Impact

Shortly after the design sprint, the Product Manager of the decarbonization team transitioned to a new opportunity, leading unfortunately to the dissolution of the team. I was re-assigned to the "Measure" workstream, where over the next seven months, I contributed to signing 15 new customers and improved internal team efficiency by 15% through my design efforts.

## Lessons Learned and Future Applications

This experience reaffirmed that Design Sprints are a powerful tool for focusing a team and generating meaningful solutions, even within tight constraints. My main challenge was effectively communicating how this process could streamline our work and deliver impactful results quickly. Drawing on my experience as a design consultant and founder, I was able to speak the specific language of my cross-functional team members, aligning our efforts.

## Feedback from Teammates
