**Background**: Carbon Direct is a climate tech startup that helps businesses and governments measure and manage their carbon footprint through advisory services and a SaaS platform. Their customer portfolio spans Fortune 500 companies, high-growth startups, and primary sector industries—all of whom expect the highest level of integrity and accuracy, which Carbon Direct is known for delivering.

**The Challenge**: When I joined Carbon Direct as a Senior Product Designer, my first assignment was to tackle a critical challenge: answering the question, “What’s next?” for customers after they received their GHG inventory from our science team. This challenge was multifaceted:


- **Unclear customer profile:** We lacked clarity on the ideal customer profile for this product area.

- **Uncertain timing:** We were unsure when customers would encounter this problem.

- **Need for speed:** Carbon Direct needed to move quickly to reassure stakeholders.

- **Complexity of the field:** Carbon management is a complex area, and while our team had limited direct experience, we had access to highly knowledgeable subject matter experts whose expertise had not yet been fully utilized.

- **Limited resources:** Our newly formed team consisted of just a Product Manager, an Engineer, and myself, with potential expansion contingent on uncovering new opportunities.

Despite these constraints, decarbonization was a key opportunity for Carbon Direct. While the company was already established in carbon removal and carbon measurement, decarbonization was the missing piece that would allow us to offer science-based, end-to-end services. However, a structured approach was needed to tackle this challenge efficiently.

## Leading the Design Sprint

With over a decade of experience in product and design, I identified an opportunity to leverage the **Design Sprint** process to address these complexities. As the Senior Product Designer, **I led, documented, and facilitated the sprint**, ensuring that we rapidly iterated on the problem and fostered creative problem-solving.

For those unfamiliar, a Design Sprint is a structured, five-day process that helps teams solve complex problems and validate ideas quickly. It involves phases like understanding the problem, sketching solutions, deciding on the best approach, prototyping, and testing with users.

**Adapting the Process:** Given our team's limited knowledge of the problem space and the lack of a clear vision from leadership, I adapted the sprint to focus on **identifying opportunities** and **involving cross-functional team members** early on. We opted to deliver a **suggested roadmap for the decarbonization workstream** and sketches rather than a prototype.

## Collaboration with Cross-Functional Teams

To align stakeholders and integrate their expertise into the process, I utilized Miro, a collaborative whiteboard tool, to track progress and facilitate meaningful contributions. Throughout the week, I scheduled individual live sessions with stakeholders to learn about their workflows and capture their insights, followed by a group session to review the work and gather feedback.

Our participants included:
- A Product Manager
- An Engineer
- A Climate Scientist
- A Carbon Accountant
- A Customer Support Manager
- A Data Analyst

Bringing together these diverse perspectives allowed us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions.


## Adapting the Design Sprint Methodology

Given our unique circumstances, I focused on the first three phases of the traditional Design Sprint —**Understand, Sketch, and Decide**— while skipping the prototype and testing phases. This adaptation enabled us to gain a solid understanding of the complex subject matter and identify potential roadmap items for the decarbonization workstream.

One key challenge during the sprint was the vast scope of our customers’ decarbonization needs. To address this, I gathered existing insights from interviews, competitor analyses, and market data within the organization.

Collaborating with the Product Manager, I ran a prioritization exercise to focus on the user pain points that would best serve both customer and business needs. We narrowed our focus to **making decarbonization insights more actionable in the platform**.


## Outcomes and Impact

The design sprint led to several valuable outcomes:

- **Market positioning:** We identified and visually represented the potential market positioning for Carbon Direct’s decarbonization solution, clarifying how our product fit into the broader competitive landscape and aligns with the company's OKRs.

- **User journeys:** We iteratively developed user journey maps that captured the entire customer experience across the carbon management process, with a deeper focus on the decarbonization phase, ensuring our solutions addressed needs at every stage.

- **Personas:**  Building on my early intel gathering efforts, we established personas that represented both current and projected customer profiles, serving as essential tools for ideation and decision-making.

- **Science Advisor tasks:** By interviewing two advisory team members, I mapped out the tasks of Science Advisors to understand their unique challenges and needs when working with customers on decarbonization strategies.

This groundwork allowed us to focus on the selected customer pain point: **making decarbonization insights more actionable within the platform**.
We mapped out a user flow for the key actors involved, gathered feedback through interviews, and distilled this feedback into “How Might We” (HMW) statements. These statements guided our ideation during the sketching phase.

I then translated the ideas generated during the sprint into a comprehensive user flow and wireframes, forming the backbone of the decarbonization roadmap. This roadmap, integrating market research, customer data, expert insights, and business goals, was presented to leadership for feedback and approval.

## Transition and Further Impact

Unfortunately, shortly after the design sprint, the Product Manager of the decarbonization team transitioned to a new opportunity, leading to the dissolution of the team. However, I was re-assigned to the “Measure” workstream, where over the next seven months, I contributed to **driving $750K in new revenue and improved internal team efficiency by 15% (~450 work hours saved annually)** through my design efforts.


## Lessons Learned and Future Applications

This experience reaffirmed that **Design Sprints** are a powerful tool for **focusing a team and generating meaningful solutions, even within tight constraints**. However, a tool like Design Sprint is only effective when tailored to the unique needs of its users. Drawing on my years of experience with various design processes, I was able to quickly adapt this approach to fit our specific circumstances.

This experience also helped me further hone my ability to effectively communicate how this process could streamline our work and deliver impactful results. Leveraging my background as a design consultant and founder, I was able to speak the language of my cross-functional colleagues, aligning our efforts and ensuring successful collaboration.
