## The Genesis

When I first joined Mentor Collective, the design landscape of the product was fragmented. The company's growth story had been written by design contractors and product enthusiasts who weren't strictly designers. This meant a product dotted with inconsistent user experiences and visual identity. As the company's first full-time design recruit, I quickly identified a need for design system to create an unified voice.

## Why a Design System?
The pace of Mentor Collective's growth was intense. Our product had to cater to both B2C and B2B audiences, a multifaceted challenge. I believed that a design system would equip our product and engineering teams to handle the looming complexity, ensuring swift and consistent delivery of user value.

## Crafting
I initiated this project by starting with an industry assessment. Given Mentor Collective's domain, the emphasis was clear: a robust dashboard design capable of handling large data set display and manipulation. A key step was to align the design system with our engineering stack for smooth integration.
I probed engineers for collaboration. They  provided valuable insights on potential open-source design systems. The recently hired design lead provided insights about the future trajectory of the design team to also inform our decision.

## Key Components & Principles
To save us time and energy, we wanted to start with an open-source design system giving us the foundational structure to expand upon. After research, we landed with Uber's Base design system. Its React-friendly nature coupled with built-in accessibility features made it stand on top of other alternatives. 
However, we weren't content with a simple adaptation. I introduced a new visual identity to align with Mentor Collective's brand, including a data visualization library (Airbnb's VisX), an icon library (IBM carbon icons) and an accessible color scheme. Our guiding principles were clear:

- Seamless React integration
- WCAG AA compliance for accessibility
- Simplified Figma usage
- A special focus on dashboard designs
- Can be used for both mobile and web use cases

## Promotion & Adoption
While my engineering team was thrilled about the design system, its realization was a collaborative effort. As Mentor Collective's first design hire, I enjoyed a unique trust from the broader organization. They believed in my ability to implement essential tools to scale the company's product. Throughout the process of creating this design system, I regularly held presentations and sessions, briefing teams about our milestones and offering hands-on tutorials, especially on Figma. Challenges arose, particularly during technical implementations, but we navigated them through close-knit teamwork.

## The Impact
Our design system transformed Mentor Collective's design narrative. It paved the way for consistent product roll-outs, even as our teams expanded. A testimonial from a Senior Software Engineer succinctly captures this transformation:

> "One of Mathieu’s most impactful early contributions to the team was collaborating with engineering to establish a thoughtful design system... This new design system was quickly used to redesign a highly visible dashboard... and saw a notable increase in visitor engagement after launch."

## Maintaining the Momentum
Ensuring the design system remained updated and relevant was vital to its long-term success. Alongside a few engineers, we set up a "Frontend guild" at Mentor Collective. This group facilitated monthly discussions around the system's evolution based on product squads' needs and challenges. This initiative became the nexus for feedback, critique, and evolution of our design system.

## The Partner Dashboard & Design System
Reflecting on the partner dashboard project, the design system's influence was key. It streamlined processes, decisions, and most importantly, it ensured a cohesive visual narrative. The Vice President of Product aptly summarized its significance:

> "Mathieu championed the need for a more modern design system... The look and feel of the Mentor Collective platform (and the ability to scale it up) is a direct result of Mathieu's efforts."

In essence, the design system wasn't just a toolkit—it was Mentor Collective's design voice, and I was privileged to be its architect.
