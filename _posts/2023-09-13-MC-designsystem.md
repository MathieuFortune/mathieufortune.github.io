## The Genesis

When I first joined Mentor Collective, the design landscape of the product was fragmented. The company's growth story had been written by design contractors and product enthusiasts who weren't strictly designers. This meant a product dotted with inconsistent user experiences and visual identity. As the company's first full-time design recruit, I quickly identified a need for design system to create an unified voice.

## Why a Design System?
The pace of Mentor Collective's growth was intense. Our product had to cater to both B2C and B2B audiences, a multifaceted challenge. I believed that a design system would equip our product and engineering teams to handle the looming complexity, ensuring swift and consistent delivery of user value.

## Crafting
I initiated this project by starting with an industry assessment. Given Mentor Collective's domain, the emphasis was clear: a robust dashboard design capable of handling large data set display and manipulation. 

A key step was to align the design system with our engineering stack for smooth integration.
I probed engineers for collaboration. They  provided valuable insights on potential open-source design systems. 
Additionally, I integrated the just hired Design Lead's insights about the future trajectory of the design team to also inform our decision.

## Key Components & Principles
To save us time and energy, we wanted to start with an open-source design system giving us the foundational structure to expand upon. 

Our guiding principles were clear:

- Seamless React integration
- WCAG AA compliance for accessibility
- Simplified Figma usage
- A special focus on dashboard designs
- Can be used for both mobile and web use cases

After research, we picked Uber's Base design system. Its React-friendly nature coupled with built-in accessibility features made it stand out from other alternatives. 

However, despite it's solid techincal foundation, we weren't content with a simple adaptation of Uber's visual identity and design principles. 

### Colors
I introduced a new color scheme to align with Mentor Collective's brand, ensuring contrast, usability and accessibility every step of the way.

### Typography
Leveraging my Design Lead's expertise with types, we tested different font famillies and typographic scales to ensure our product would be accessible and usable on every devices. I also researched and picked an icon library (IBM carbon icons) that would fit our new typographic style and suit our needs for dashboard designs.

### Data visualization and various component tweaks
With the help of engineers, we picked a data visualization library (Airbnb's VisX). I worked on creating the various chart type that would be needed in our product as well as making sure to test colors to maximize accessibility.

Besides colors and typography, I also made sure that every components would fit our project needs by tweaking and adding new ones where needed.

## Promotion & Adoption
While my engineering team was thrilled about the design system, its realization was a collaborative effort. 

As Mentor Collective's first design hire, I enjoyed a unique trust from the broader organization. They believed in my ability to implement essential tools to scale the company's product. 

Throughout the process of creating this design system, I regularly held presentations and rubber-ducking sessions, briefing teams about our milestones and offering hands-on tutorials, especially on Figma. With the collaboration of the Design Lead, we iteratively implemented usage rules and other documentation to each component in the system.

Challenges arose, particularly during technical implementations, but I navigated them through close-knit teamwork with engineers and quality control during our projects.

## The Impact
Our design system transformed Mentor Collective's design narrative. It paved the way for consistent product roll-outs, even as our teams expanded. A testimonial from a Senior Software Engineer succinctly captures this transformation:

> "One of Mathieu’s most impactful early contributions to the team was collaborating with engineering to establish a thoughtful design system... This new design system was quickly used to redesign a highly visible dashboard... and saw a notable increase in visitor engagement after launch."

## Maintaining the Momentum
Ensuring the design system remained updated and relevant was vital to its long-term success. Alongside a few engineers, we set up a "Frontend guild" at Mentor Collective. This group facilitated monthly discussions around the system's evolution based on product squads' needs and challenges. This initiative became the nexus for feedback, critique, and evolution of our design system.

## The Partner Dashboard & Design System
Reflecting on the partner dashboard project, the design system's influence was key. It streamlined processes, decisions, and most importantly, it ensured a cohesive visual narrative. The Vice President of Product aptly summarized its significance:

> "Mathieu championed the need for a more modern design system... The look and feel of the Mentor Collective platform (and the ability to scale it up) is a direct result of Mathieu's efforts."

In essence, the design system wasn't just a toolkit—it was Mentor Collective's design voice, and I was privileged to be its architect.
