Participating in a Daily UI challenge help to improve and expand your skills as a designer.

It's a great way to break outside of the confort zone and develop self-control to sit down every day to design solution to a user experience problem.

If your also interested in trying it, go to [dailyui.co](http://www.dailyui.co/ "Website to subscribe to the Daily UI challenge"){:target="_blank"} and subscribe. Each day you'll receive in my email box a new prompt to design.

For this challenge I decided to stick to a 2 hour limited time to design each day.
This way I have to focus during a short period of time and also to avoid loosing my all day of client work 8) .
