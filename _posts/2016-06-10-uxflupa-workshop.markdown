## Overview

The 7th of April 2016, the montly Montpellier FLUPA's MeetUp taked place in 1001pharmacies.com offices.

It follow a proposition I sent to FLUPA managers. The idea was to plan users testings workshops where everybody can bring and present his products in order to be tested by meet-up's participants.

Around 50 people were present. Finnaly, only 1001pharmacies.com's products were tested because no one have an another product to show.

This meet-up was co-organized with Amanda Martinez (Wonderful Digital), Chloé Pellen (Tabmo Engineering) and myself.

I was in charge of planning, logistic and animation of the differents workshops.

## Progress

I was inspired and help by methods from Carine Lallemand's book 'Méthode de design UX' to plan these workshops.

3 test were choosen to allow participants experiment the first MVP (minimum viable product) iteration of the 1001pharmacies.com funnel.

These tests were held by 3 people with one computer. An interviewer, an interviewee and an observer.

The first test consisted in better know people who were tested with a mini exploratory survey.

In a will to emphasize on user tests (the time of the workshop is limited), questions have been minimized.
They were:

Age, Sex, City ?
Are you a buying decision maker ?
Are you used to shop online ?
Do you know 1001pharmacies.com ?
If yes, have you ever ordered on 1001pharmacies.com ?
Do you love ponies ?

The second test was what we call the "5 seconds test".
It allow to collect first impressions of a person on a given element.
This test was performed on the home page of the site in order to know the feelings of users at first glance.

Finally, the third test concerned the ordering process. Interviewees were invited to follow a script guiding them through the buying process.

<blockquote>
Every year, summer comes, I want to order my beach panoply (sun cream, a refreshing spray and moisturizer).
</blockquote>

After the scenario, respondents were asked to complete an "AttrakDiff", a survey to assess the pragmatic and hedonic qualities of a system.

## Results

Data were aggregated and analyzed.

The purpose of this workshop was primarily to provide an opportunity for participants to become familiar with the methods of user testing.
For 1001pharmacies, feedbacks were very positive, and it allow us to confirmed our assumptions about funnel's user experience.


## Test #1

Integration of exploratory surveys feedback's into a google form to better visualize data.

## Test #2

Feedbacks of the 5 seconds test were grouped into keywords.
These keywords allowed us to identify feelings of users discovering the 1001pharmacies.com site.
Consequently, elements that may hinder understanding of the user has been modified thanks to these feedbacks.


## Test #3

Once AttrakDiff were aggregated, we obtained a graphical representation of results.

Each graphs represent the average score of the system's 4 groups of qualities by user point of view :

PQ : Pragmatic Quality
HQI : Hedonic Quality of Identification
HQS : Hedonic Quality of Stimulation
ATT : Overall Attractiveness

More a value of a quality is positive, more it's present in the service. Conversely for negative values. The objective is therefore to juggle with these qualities in order to get the result we aimed for the service. For example: On a funnel, the pragmatic aspect is important.

I invite you to read the [article by Carine Lallemand](https://uxmind.eu/2014/06/23/attrakdiff-evaluation-quantitative-ux/ "Carine Lallemand's article") for further explanation of this method (FR).

We can see from the charts below that values of attractiveness and pragmatism are relatively positive while hedonism is less present. This means that the items in the pages are simple, clear and accessible.

## Conclusion

The user experience of the basket shows a neutral character slightly oriented tasks. This is positive because the objective of the funnel is to guide the user in the final purchase process, it's a moment of concentration which should not be distracted by parasitic elements.
