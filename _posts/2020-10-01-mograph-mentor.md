## Overview

Mograph Mentor is an online motion graphics school. Our mission is to challenge the current status of higher education in the Art field. Through on-demand training and mentorship classes, we help artists and animators learn new skills, create original work for their portfolio to ultimately launch their careers.

## Deliverables

I joined Mograph Mentor in late 2018 when the company was a side-project. My business partner needed a technical and design-savvy partner to help achieve the company’s vision.

My first mission was to design a new website capable of supporting the business’ growth and course catalog expansion. For this project I designed:

- **A new company website**
- **New Brand Identity (i.e., logo, color palette, typography, brand guidelines)**

## The Challenge

Learning new skills and create original portfolio pieces are daunting and time-consuming tasks. Especially for motion designers who have to rely heavily on their portfolio to find a job. Educational content around the motion design field has boomed in the last 5 years.

In order to compete and grow in this highly competitive landscape, Mograph Mentor needed to depart from a side-project and become a legitimate company capable of attracting new audiences. By creating a new website and brand identity, the business will gain visibility, legitimacy and get the foundations needed to apply its business strategy.

## Final Product

### New Website for Mograph Mentor

Mograph Mentor needed a new brand identity and website capable of supporting the business growth and to compete in a niche industry becoming more and more crowded. I designed, tested, and launched a new brand and fully functional website to market Mograph Mentor’s business and increase brand awareness across the industry.

### Brand Identity Guidelines

Mograph Mentor sought to differentiate itself from its competitors through a brand identity that was clean, artistic, and welcoming.

With these attributes in mind, I designed a new logo, color palette, and typography. I then created brand guidelines and a design system to facilitate future improvements and streamline communication with cross-functional team members.

## Design Research

### Audit revealed content organization and navigation issues.

To begin my research, I conducted an audit of the former website. The former website had an aging look, lack of accessibility, and defective navigation making it tricky to find the course’s sales pages. From an SEO point of view, the page semantic and keywords mapping was completely absent as well. The web performances were also negatively impacted by the lack of proper image optimizations.

In short, the website’s design and usability were far from where they needed to be to support the business needs.

### Industry & Market research led to important discoveries about how the motion design industry operates and the current state of online education for motion design.

Researching how the industry operates and who are the main actors driving it was essential to successfully lead this project.

I noticed that this industry is segmented into three fields: Gaming, Movies, and Consumer Products.

The Motion Graphics market is projected to be worth 270 billion U.S Dollars by 2020. For the last 10 years, this industry has rapidly grown thanks to several technological breakthroughs and an increase in computing power.

Initially composed of a majority of freelancers, the need for motion design is becoming more and more recognized by companies. This results in a rapid increase in in-house opportunities.

### Competitive research revealed differentiating factor and branding opportunity

To perform my competitive research, I reviewed 25 organizations more or less connected with online motion design education. Since our competitors have a significant lead in terms of market share and team size, my goal was to identify our most differentiating factor and branding opportunity.

This research revealed that our 3 most direct competitors are as follows: SchoolOfMotion, MotionDesignSchool, and GreyScaleGorilla.

I also listed out our indirect and potential competitors in a spreadsheet document to be able to easily track them.

### Understand our early adopters and research new audiences to design a better user experience

I interviewed 4 students and 2 mentors (course instructors) who were early adopters of the business.

These interviews revealed the first series of insights into the mindsets and behaviors of motion designers seeking education. Motion designers seeking an education often encounter these problems:

“I need a portfolio of original work to distinguish myself from other artists”
“Getting constructive and meaningful feedback on my project is difficult”
“Improving my skills and creating compelling work is daunting and time-consuming”
“I don’t know what I should learn and create to help drive my career in the direction I need”

To confirm my initial assumptions and get a better grasp of the target audience, I expanded my research.

I used Google search, public forums like Quora and Reddit, and Facebook Groups to study the different audiences that constitute the world of motion design. 

I also implemented a survey in our most downloaded free course to probe our beginner audience.

Based on the collected qualitative and quantitative data from our target audiences, I established two personas:

### Mograph Mentor’s underdog position in the market required us to move fast about our technical stack choice.

Since the main competitors of Mograph Mentor already had a significant advance in terms of technology, market share, and brand visibility, we needed a quick and reliable technical solution to be able to compete as soon as possible.

Furthermore, our competitor and user research revealed that the technical aspect of our solution was less important to our target audience than the actual quality of the educational content.

This new tech stack will serve as the MVP of our business. To avoid building any critical technical debt, I choose a combination of WordPress for the marketing site and Teachable as our LMS.

## Design Iterations

### Design Goals

To help me drive the decision making and prioritize design decision, I create design goals:

**Clarity**: The old website was suffering from a cluttered and aging look. To better convey our mission to our customers, a clean design will be the first building block of our growth.

**Performance First**: With all the products that require on-site conversion, I want my design to be optimized for web performance. This goal also aligns with my design philosophy, Form follows Function.

**Better Navigation**: The old website was missing a critical navigation path to access the on-demand courses. These on-demand courses representing our revenue’s baseline, straightforward navigation to them, were imperative to the business’s success.

**Feature Our Mentors**: Our school wishes to promote human interactions above all else. In my competitor analysis and user research, we also learned that promoting our mentors was key for our market positioning.

**Improved Tracking**: Data-driven decisions are crucial to success. Since the previous website had no tracking, I was working in the dark. To avoid this in the future, I designed this new website with tracking features in mind.

**Iterate, Iterate, Iterate**: A design is never finished. Iterate on it with the help of data and usability tests was mandatory for this new website’s success. I designed this website in 3 sprints with tests at the end of each cycle.

### Brand Development

To help me in my design of the new website, I developed a new brand identity that will convey our message with better clarity.

The initial color palette was heavily focusing on a combination of lime green and dark colors.
Due to the lack of contrast of the lime green, I decided to add a complementary color that will serve as primary color.

### User Flow

Based on the user research, I designed a basic user flow aiming at describing the moment a user enters our website until they convert and access their course content.

### Wireframes

Multiple rounds of wireframes and ideation cycles helped me pinpoint the best navigation and set of features for the new website.

When I work individually on a design project, I like to sketch my wireframe on a notebook to accelerate this ideation process. If I work with a team, I prefer to use proper wireframing software like Figma or Invision.

{% include lazy-image.html src="/images/mograph-mentor-cs-wireframes.jpg" alt="Wireframes" caption="I like to sketch my wireframes with paper and pencil" figClass="" %}


### Usability test and A/B tests

For each design implementation, I made sure to perform regular tests such as in-person usability tests, heatmaps, user flow recordings, and A/B tests.

The goal was to ensure that each new design implementation fulfills its intended objective.

### Learnings & Impact

I really enjoyed working on this project. It showed me how design isn't just a visual expression. It's also making sure that you understand the business needs, market conditions, and user behaviors to create the most usable and compelling solution.

This new website, combined with a marketing strategy and informed course development roadmap resulted in increased monthly revenue by +75%, website traffic by +171%, and active customer count by +147% in 12 months.

After the first year of operation, we were able to increase the size of the team to add a Creative Director, a Marketing Assistant and 2 Video Editors.
