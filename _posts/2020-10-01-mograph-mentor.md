## Circumstance

I joined Mograph Mentor in late 2018 when the company was aside-project. My business partner needed a technical anddesign savvy partner to help achieve the company’s vision.

Mograph Mentor is an online motion graphics school. Ourmission is to challenge the current status of higher education inthe Art field. Through on-demand training and mentorshipclasses, we help artists and animators learn new skills, createoriginal work for their portfolio to ultimately launch their career.

## Role

As a co-founder, I’m wearing multiple hats (UX research, product design, engineering, marketing, business, customer happiness). This role makes me harness all the skills and experience I accumulated during my career.
I’m acting as Chief Operating Officer, overseeing the daily operational activities while my business partner as CEO focuses on the intellectual property development (course content, instructor relationship, copywriting, etc).

## Goal

How might we implement a new website capable of supporting the growth and course catalog expansion with an enhanced user experience while remaining faithful to our brand story and vision? To help tackle this challenge, I broke it down as follow:

- Define audiences and competitors to inform course development roadmap and market positioning
- Assess technical stack and marketing needs
- Establish a shared vision for the look and feel of our products and brand
- Design & Develop a new marketing site capable of sustaining our growth and course catalog expansion
- Create a marketing strategy to support growth and revenue increase

## Actions

*Disclaimer: Due to the confidential nature of some of these topics, I limited the scope and results shared in this case study.*

### Research and define target audiences

#### Industry & market analysis

I  started my research by getting more acquainted with the motion design industry. Making sure that I understand correctly how this industry operates and who are the main actors driving it. This helped me focus during my discovery research and helped us better define our market and brand positioning.

I noticed that this industry is segmented in three fields: **Gaming, Movies, and Consumer Products**.

The Motion Graphics market is projected to be **worth 270 billion U.S Dollars by 2020**. For the last 10 years, this industry has rapidly grown thanks to the increase in computing power.

**Initially composed of a majority of freelance gigs**, the need for motion design is becoming more and more recognized by companies. This results in **a rapid increase in in-house opportunities**.

#### Discovery research

During discovery research, I interviewed **4 students** and **2 mentors** (course instructors). These interviews of our early adopters revealed the first series of insights into the mindsets and behaviors of motion designers seeking education. Motion designers seeking an education often encounter these problems:

- “I need a portfolio of **original work to distinguish myself** from other artists”
- “Getting **constructive and meaningful feedback** on my project is difficult”
- “Improving my skills and delivering good project is **daunting and time-consuming**”
- “**I don’t know what I should learn and create** to help drive my career in the direction I need”

To confirm our initial assumptions and get a better grasp of the audience, I expanded my research.

I used Google search, public forums like Quora and Reddit, and Facebook Groups to study the different audiences that constitute the world of motion design.
I also implemented a survey in our most downloaded free course to probe our beginner audience.

Based on the **collected qualitative and quantitative data** from our target audiences, I established two personas:

### Market and competitor analysis

To better inform our brand and market positioning, I reviewed **25+ companies** more or less connected to online education and motion design. The goal was to position our business in a “blue ocean” strategy (see Blue Ocean Strategy book by Renée Mauborgne and W. Chan Kim)

Our top 3 direct competitors consist of the following organizations:
SchoolOfMotion, MotionDesignSchool, Greyscale Gorilla

Indirect competitors:
Coding/Design bootcamps, TheFutur

Potential/Substitute competitors:
Traditional Art Schools, Skillshare, Domestika, Linkedin Learn, Lambda School

Despite its niche nature, the online education for motion designers has boomed in the last 5 years. In order to better position our business, I compared our offer with our 3 closest competitors:

This analysis informed us that our best market opportunity was to focus on our strength and most differentiating factor, connect students with industry professionals that can serve as a mentor for them.

### Assess needs from the technical stack
Based on our user research and competitor analysis, we discovered that our customers aren’t tech-savvy and focus more on the quality of the content of our courses rather than the way they consume it.

Since our competitors already have a significant advance in terms of technology, market share, and visibility, we decided to move fast with an easily manageable tech stack.

The flexibility offered by Wordpress combined with an easy to setup Teachable platform allowed us to move quickly and focus on our revenue generation and marketing strategy.

## Design process

As the sole Product Designer and Developer, I conducted all the discovery research, user interviews, prototyping, high-fidelity designs, and user testing to deliver this project from begining to end.

### Goals for the website re-design

After this first research round, it was time to define the goals of this website redesign. This will help me drive my decision making and priorities for this project.

**Clean Look**: The old website design was suffering from a cluttered and aging look. A clean look will enable future improvements.

**Performance First**: With all the products that require on-site conversion, I want my design to be optimized for web performance. This goal also aligns with my design philosophy, Form follows Function.

**Better Navigation**: The old website was missing a critical navigation path to access the on-demand courses. These on-demand courses representing our revenue's baseline, straightforward navigation to them, were imperative to the business's success.

**Feature Our Mentors**: Our school wishes to promote human interactions above all else. In my competitor analysis and user research, we also learned that promoting our mentors was key for our market positioning.

**Improved Tracking**: Data-driven decisions are crucial to success. Since the previous website had no tracking, I was working in the dark. To avoid this in the future, I designed the new website with tracking features in mind.

**Iterate, Iterate, Iterate**: A design is never finished. Iterate on it with the help of data and usability test was mandatory for this new website's success. I designed this website in 3 sprints with tests at the end of each cycles.

### Wireframes

Multiple rounds of wireframes and ideation cycles helped me pinpoint the best navigation and set of features for the new website.

### Design System & Brand Identity

To help me keep a consistent look across the website, I started by creating a design system and a new brand identity.

Because the lime green color present in the logo will create an accessibility issue, I decided to depart from it and add a complementary color to serve as primary color for our call to action.

The design system is my go-to tool when creating new designs. Thanks to my background in front-end development, I'm conscient of the importance of a good design handoff

### Learnings & Outcomes

*Disclaimer: Due to the confidential nature of some of these topics, I limited the scope and results shared in this case study.*

I really enjoyed working on this project. It showed me how design isn't just a visual expression. It's also making sure that you understand the business needs, market conditions and user behaviors to create the most usable and compelling solution.

This new website, combined with a marketing strategy and informed course development roadmap, resulted in **increased monthly revenue by +75%**, **website traffic by +171%**, and **active customer count by +147%** in 12 months.

After the first year of operation, we were able to increase the size of the team to add a Creative Director, a Marketing Assistant and 2 Video Editors.
