## Circumstance

I joined Mograph Mentor in late 2018 when the company was a side-project. My business partner needed a technical and design savvy partner to help achieve the company’s vision.

Mograph Mentor is an online motion graphics school. Our mission is to challenge the current status of higher education in the Art field. Through on-demand training and mentorship classes, we help artists and animators learn new skills, create original work for their portfolio to ultimately launch their career.

## Role

As a co-founder, I’m wearing multiple hats (UX research, product design, engineering, marketing, business, customer happiness). This role makes me harness all the skills and experience I accumulated during my career.
I’m acting as Chief Operating Officer, overseeing the daily operational activities while my business partner as CEO focuses on the intellectual property development (course content, instructor relationship, copywriting, etc).

## Goal

Starting from a side-project, the company was only constituted of 3 courses hosted on a third-party platform and a simple marketing site. My goals were as follow:

- Define audiences and competitors to inform course development roadmap and market positioning
- Assess technical stack and marketing needs
- Establish a shared vision for the look and feel of our products and brand
- Design & Develop a new marketing site capable of sustaining our growth and course catalog expansion
- Create a marketing strategy to support growth and revenue increase

## Actions

*Disclaimer: Due to the confidential nature of some of these topics, I limited the scope and results shared in this case study.*

### Research and define target audiences

#### Industry & market analysis

I started my research by getting more acquainted with the motion design industry. Making sure that I understand correctly how this industry operates, and who are the main actors driving it. This helped me focus during my discovery research and helped us better define our market and brand positioning.

#### Discovery research

During discovery research, I interviewed **4 students** and **2 mentors** (course instructors). These interviews of our early adopters revealed the first series of insights into the mindsets and behaviors of motion designers seeking education. Motion designers seeking an education often encounter these problems:

- “I need a portfolio of **original work to distinguish myself** from other artists”
- “Getting **constructive and meaningful feedback** on my project is difficult”
- “Improving my skills and delivering good project is **daunting and time-consuming**”
- “**I don’t know what I should learn and create** to help drive my career in the direction I need”

To confirm our initial assumptions and get a better grasp of the audience, I expanded my research.

I used Google search, public forums like Quora and Reddit, and Facebook Groups to study the different audiences that constitute the world of motion design.
I also implemented a survey in our most downloaded free course to probe our beginner audience.

Based on the **collected qualitative and quantitative data** from our target audiences, I established two personas:

### Market and competitor analysis

To better inform our brand and market positioning, I reviewed **25+ companies** more or less connected to online education and motion design. The goal was to position our business in a “blue ocean” strategy (see Blue Ocean Strategy book by Renée Mauborgne and W. Chan Kim)

Our top 3 direct competitors consist of the following organizations:
SchoolOfMotion, MotionDesignSchool, Greyscale Gorilla

Indirect competitors:
Coding/Design bootcamps, TheFutur

Potential/Substitute competitors:
Traditional Art Schools, Skillshare, Domestika, Linkedin Learn, Lambda School

Despite its niche nature, the online education for motion designers has boomed in the last 5 years. In order to better position our business, I compared our offer with our 3 closest competitors:

This analysis informed us to focus on our strenght and most differentiating factor, **connect students with industry profesionnals that can serve as a mentor for them.**

### Assess needs from the technical stack
Based on our user research and competitor analysis, we discovered that our customers aren’t tech-savvy and focus more on the quality of the content of our courses rather than the way they consume it.

Since our competitors already have a significant advance in terms of technology, market share, and visibility, we decided to move fast with an easily manageable tech stack.

The flexibility offered by Wordpress combined with an easy to setup Teachable platform allowed us to move quickly and focus on our revenue generation and marketing strategy.

### Development process

To build the new version of Mograph Mentor capable of supporting our growth; I followed a design thinking and agile development process over several sprint cycles.

As the sole Product Designer and Developer, I conducted all the discovery research, user interviews, prototyping, high-fidelity designs, and user testing to deliver this project from begining to end.

### Impact

*Disclaimer: Due to the confidential nature of some of these topics, I limited the scope and results shared in this case study.*

The user research and competitor analysis also allowed me to better inform the course develoment roadmap managed by my business partner.

My actions resulted in **increased monthly revenue by +75%**, **website traffic by +171%**, and **active customer count by +147%** in 12 months.

After the first year of operation, we were able to increase the size of the team to add a Creative Director, a Marketing Assistant and 2 Video Editors.
