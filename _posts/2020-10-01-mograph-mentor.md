### Circumstance

I joined Mograph Mentor when the company was still a side-project.
My business partner needed a web and UX savvy partner to get the company to a legitimate business level.
We built up a company that helps aspiring motion designers improve their careers by getting mentored by the industry's best artist while creating original portfolio pieces.

### Goal

Build up and grow the business from a side-project to an actual company.

### Actions

I created a new website from the ground up to host the newly developed courses and improve conversion and tracking. Put in place a brand and marketing strategy to differentiate the brand and expand the audience. I also led user research and competitive analysis to inform the course roadmap.

### Results

My actions resulted in increased monthly revenue by +75%, website traffic by +171%, and active customer count by +147% in 12 months.
