Let's see the design process behind creating a website for a fictitious jet ski rental company based in Miami, FL. This behind the scene case study will display the different steps that lead me to create a website.

### Competitor Analysis

At the beginning of the project, we conduct a competitor analysis to find out how our website will compare with its competitors. When we design a product for an audience, we are not used to working with, it's a good idea to look at the competitors to find some first insights.
To find those competitors, we are typing the most obvious keywords that come to our mind in Google search bar. The auto-complete feature of Google search bar is also a good way to find the most typed research about a specific topic:

- Jet ski rental Miami
- Jet ski tour Miami
- Water activities Miami
- …

For our jet ski rental website, we found out that the competitors are big websites like Trip Advisor, Groupon, Yelp, "top 10" websites, and small businesses.
Websites like Trip Advisor or Yelp are a good source of information as we can read customer reviews and learn more about what they liked and disliked. That's a first data entry to build our personas too.
Small businesses' websites are an excellent intel source to find any specific feature we might skip during the ideation phase, to get a sense of what's currently available to the customer and a first data entry to eventually build a lean canvas.

### User research

{% include lazy-image.html src="/images/case-study-jet-ski-rental-topics-map.jpg" alt="User research" caption="Topics maps and questions draft" figClass="" %}

To start the research, we create topic maps of words and phrases that come to mind when we think of jet skiing in Miami. These topics maps will be used as references to create a user survey, which will be sent out online to various potential users.
With the survey responses, we are able to found some common threads that give us a better picture of the user's potential pain points, expectations, and what we can show on our website.
Survey responses can lead us to the direction we know we need to take with our website.
We can also use the questions in the survey as a start for in-person qualitative interviews. 
Qualitative interviews are best suited to understand more deeply users' needs and ways of thinking. It involves more listening and empathy than just blunt questions and answers for an online survey.

With all these information, we usually also gain some insights we would have not fully consider before.

### Affinity mapping

Through affinity mapping, we compile answers from our surveys and interviews and group them to find common trends. 
Affinity mappings are best suited when you are designing solo or in group to help organize observations and ideas that surface during the research and ideation phase.
We can validate our directions, initial thoughts, and pinpoint key things users might have in common, then take everything we learn into consideration when designing the website.

### Personas

Based on the competitive analysis and user research, we can develop several personas to represent our target demographics and psychographics. 
There are two personas, who are primaries. It means that every needs should be fulfilled by the website. You can sometimes also have secondary personas (example here: Event planner who look to book for an office seminar) which have other needs but less important to the primary ones when it comes to prioritizing times and resources to develop the website features. 
Our personas here are: Sightseeing traveler, Water sports enthusiast.
Personas are an archetype representation of real users that helps the design team to develop empathy and focus during the ideation, design, and iteration phases. They help keep in mind that we aren't designing for us designer but for a specific type of user.

### User stories

With the personas and competitive analysis, we can start to think about designing the website's features with a user story approach.
User stories are useful to create a roadmap of the feature we will implement to cover all of the needs of our personas. Originally, user stories are used in Scrum Agile methods to represent stakeholders and users' needs in a project and help prioritize the team's workflows.
To construct a user story, you write a structured sentence allowing the team to focus on the WHAT instead of the HOW to do things. This gives more freedom to creativity to solve user's needs.

- As a Sightseeing traveler, I want to know what there is to see on a jet ski tour in order to anticipate my experience.
- As a Sightseeing traveler, I want to find information about security and content of the tour in order to feel reassured about the legitimacy of the offer.
- …
- As a Water Sports Enthusiast, I want to read like-minded people reviews in order to confirm that the jet ski rental is the right choice.
- As a Water Sports Enthusiast, I want to know the full price options in order to share the information with my friends and decide quickly.
- …

### Sitemap and User Flow

{% include lazy-image.html src="/images/case-study-jet-ski-rental-sitemap-user-flow.jpg" alt="Sitemap and user flow" caption="Sitemap and user flow" figClass="" %}

We create a sitemap and user flow of the website that we will confront with the design team and/or users to facilitate the design phase.

### Wireframe (low-fidelity mockup)

{% include lazy-image.html src="/images/case-study-jet-ski-rental-wireframe-low-fidelity-mockup.jpg" alt="Wireframes (low fidelity mockups)" caption="Wireframes (low fidelity mockups)" figClass="" %}

Once we have a concept of a few main features and flows that we want to expand upon, it's time to put your hands in the grease and start designing the first wireframes of the website.
When we are doing this phase in a team, it's a good idea to use the Design Studio method to communicate our ideas further. We individually sketch rapid prototypes and then come back together to critique, collaborate, and decide which ideas we want to continue to build and focus on. It's a brainstorm and immediate feedback exercise that help with critique and feedback while being fast. If you had to design in solo, don't be afraid to share on community slack and with friends what you are doing to gather feedback. Several brains are often better than one when trying to ideate and innovate.

### Designs (high-fidelity mockup)

Now that we agree with the wireframes, we start to design high fidelity mockups of the website. The first thing we do is to create a mood board that will contain typographies, color palette, photo selections, … This mood board is used to generate creativity and give a general sense of the feeling we want to communicate with the design. Then from that, we convert the wireframe into a high fidelity design that will serve for validation with the client/stakeholders. The high fidelity mockup doesn't have to follow exactly the wireframe as new ideas could emerge when adding color and pictures.
