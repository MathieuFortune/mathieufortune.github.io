Promeo is a well-known real estate developer in the South of France. They needed to refresh their website to be align with their new brand identity. From a first iteration of the new user interfaces, I expanded the design and developed the new wordpress application.


### Context

Promeo is a well-known real estate developer in the South of France.

They recently renewed their brand identity and needed to align their website with these new guidelines. The website is made with wordpress from a tailored made theme.
 
I was in charge of completing the web design left by a previous designer and implementing it into the custom made wordpress theme. This new design necessitated to create new functionality as well.
