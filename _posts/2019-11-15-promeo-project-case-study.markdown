Promeo is a well-known real estate developer in the South of France. They needed to refresh its website to be aligned with their new brand identity. From the first iteration of the new user interfaces, I expanded the design and developed the new WordPress application.


### Context

Promeo is a well-known real estate developer in the South of France.

They recently renewed their brand identity and needed to align their website with these new guidelines. The site is powered with WordPress from a custom made theme.
 
I was in charge of completing the web design left by a previous designer and implementing it into the custom made WordPress theme. This new design necessitated creating new functionality as well.

### Outcome

It was a great opportunity to work with a really nice client on a complete start to finish web project.
