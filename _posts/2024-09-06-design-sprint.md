            <p>
                Shortly after joining Carbon Direct, I leveraged my skills and experience to craft and facilitate a cross-functional collaborative effort aiming to rapidly define the potential product roadmap of the "Decarbonization" workstream. Despite challenges including a newly formed team, limited domain knowledge, lack of leadership direction, and limited insights into users' decarbonization needs, I identified an opportunity to adapt a Design Sprint to overcome these obstacles and generate praised levels of collaboration and team building.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within a week, I led our team to establish clear market positioning, identify customer journeys, define ideal customer targets, engage subject matter experts, generate informed sketches, and deliver a comprehensive flowchart and wireframes to guide the product roadmap. Beyond delivering a roadmap, this project reinforced collaboration between carbon scientists and the wider product team, fostering a more collaborative and inclusive environment while promoting the value of design across the organization.

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>
                As I joined Carbon Direct, I was immediately presented with an exciting challenge that would test my skills as a Senior Product Designer. Carbon Direct, a company known for its robust, science-backed solutions, helps businesses and governments measure and manage their carbon footprint through advisory services and a SaaS platform. Serving a diverse customer portfolio, including Fortune 500 companies, high-growth startups, and primary sector industries, Carbon Direct offers comprehensive solutions that allow customers to manage their carbon footprint across three key areas: measurement (GHG inventory), reduction (decarbonization strategies), and removal (carbon credit voluntary market).
            </p>
            <p>
                While well-established in the measurement and removal spaces, the "Decarbonization" area, focusing on reduction and mitigation strategies, represented a new opportunity for Carbon Direct to expand its offerings and impact. I was thrilled to be tasked with joining the newly formed Decarbonization team and establishing the scope and roadmap for this workstream. Our starting point was a common customer question:
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize-box">
                <div class="heading">"What is next after receiving my carbon footprint report?"</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                I collaborated closely with Laura (Sr. Product Manager) and Jasper (Sr. Engineer) as the core team. To ensure we leveraged all available expertise, I also involved cross-functional stakeholders in collaborative workshops, including a Climate Scientist, Customer Support Manager, Carbon Accountant, and Data Analyst.
            </p>
            <p>
            I structured the project to run for 5 days, with the following key milestones:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect existing insights about customers and the market</li>
                <li>Identify past decarbonization efforts and pain points</li>
                <li>Focus the scope and prioritize a user problem to solve</li>
                <li>Run collaborative sessions to validate assumptions, test ideas, and generate sketches</li>
                <li>Develop a user flow and wireframes representing potential solutions</li>
                <li>Present results to leadership</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>As I dove into the project, I quickly realized our team faced several significant challenges:</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="emphasize-box">

        <div class="col-md-12 mt-xl">
            <p>These challenges reflected Carbon Direct's broader aim of productizing deep scientific expertise and bespoke advisory solutions into a scalable SaaS platform. I was excited by the opportunity to showcase how we could achieve this while identifying the ideal customer profile for maximum impact.</p>

            <h2>Approach and Methodology</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
                To rapidly align the team and leverage internal expertise under tight timelines, I adapted the Design Sprint to focus on the Understand, Sketch, and Decide phases. I was confident that tailoring the Design Sprint would allow us to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather existing customer insights and identify past decarbonization efforts</li>
                <li>Accelerate the team's learning curve by engaging carbon science experts</li>
                <li>Make rapid decisions to move forward despite uncertainty</li>
                <li>Focus on translating domain expertise into compelling platform features</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I facilitated collaborative Miro workshops to map the problem space, sketch solutions, and define a roadmap. Additionally, I conducted individual interviews with cross-functional stakeholders to gather insights and validate assumptions.

            <h2>Challenges encountered during the sprint</h2>
            <p>As a senior product designer facilitating this design sprint, I encountered and overcame several challenges. Two significant hurdles we faced were managing scope and focus, and maximizing limited stakeholder availability:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="bold">Managing Scope and Focus</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">The challenge:</span> After our first day of the sprint, the breadth of gaps and opportunities we had identified was overwhelming. It became clear we couldn't address all these points within the constraints of our sprint, potentially derailing our progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I quickly brought the issue to the team's attention, facilitating an open discussion about the various opportunities and their potential impact.</li>
                <li>Together, we made the difficult but necessary decision to draw a line in the sand and move forward with a specific long-term goal.</li>
                <li>I ensured we thoroughly documented our decision-making process, anticipating the need to justify our choice later.</li>
                <li>We created a backlog of the other identified opportunities, preserving these valuable insights for future exploration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">The outcome:</span> This decision-making process allowed us to move forward with a clear focus while keeping track of future areas to explore. We chose a goal that we believed would best synergize with our customer needs and business objectives. By addressing this challenge head-on, we maintained momentum and delivered more impactful results by the end of the week, while also demonstrating our strategic thinking to stakeholders.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p class="bold">Maximizing Limited Stakeholder Availability</p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">The challenge:</span> Ensuring efficient use of our science advisors' limited time during the sprint was crucial. These key stakeholders had numerous responsibilities, and their availability was constrained.
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I conducted preliminary research to understand the science advisors' roles and responsibilities.</li>
                <li>This groundwork allowed my team to formulate informed assumptions about their work processes and pain points.</li>
                <li>I established a clear schedule and structure for each interview, preparing targeted questions and scenarios based on our assumptions.</li>
                <li>During the interviews, we focused on quickly validating or challenging these assumptions, rather than engaging in open-ended discussions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">The outcome:</span> This strategic approach allowed us to gather maximum insights in minimum time, respecting our stakeholders' busy schedules while still obtaining crucial information. By thoroughly preparing and structuring our interactions, we made the most of the limited time available, ensuring that every minute with our science advisors contributed valuable insights to our sprint outcomes. This experience underscored the importance of preparation and strategic thinking in design sprints, especially when working with stakeholders who have significant time constraints.
