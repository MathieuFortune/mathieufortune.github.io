title: "Adapting a Design Sprint to rapidly deliver a product roadmap at Carbon Direct"
excerpt: |
  In this case study, I explore how I adapted and led a design sprint at Carbon Direct, a climate tech startup. Our goal was to tackle complex challenges and create a decarbonization roadmap for the company's carbon management platform. This project showcases my problem-solving approach, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and the customized methods I used to deliver impactful, user-centric solutions.

                Shortly after joining Carbon Direct, I leveraged my skills and experience to craft and facilitate a cross-functional collaborative effort aiming to rapidly define the potential product roadmap of the "Decarbonization" workstream. Despite challenges including a newly formed team, limited domain knowledge, lack of leadership direction, and limited insights into users' decarbonization needs, I identified an opportunity to adapt a Design Sprint to overcome these obstacles and generate praised levels of collaboration and team building.

            <p>
                Within a week, we established clear market positioning, identified customer journeys, defined ideal customer targets, engaged subject matter experts, generated informed sketches, and delivered a comprehensive user flow and wireframes to guide the product roadmap. Beyond delivering a roadmap, this project reinforced collaboration between carbon scientists and the wider product team, fostering a more collaborative and inclusive environment while promoting the value of design across the organization.

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>
                Carbon Direct, a company known for its robust, science-backed solutions, helps businesses and governments measure and manage their carbon footprint through advisory services and a SaaS platform. Serving a diverse customer portfolio, including Fortune 500 companies, high-growth startups, and primary sector industries, Carbon Direct offers comprehensive solutions that allow customers to manage their carbon footprint across three key areas: measurement (GHG inventory), reduction (decarbonization strategies), and removal (carbon credit voluntary market). While well-established in the measurement and removal spaces, the "Decarbonization" area, focusing on reduction and mitigation strategies, represented a new opportunity for Carbon Direct to expand its offerings and impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first assignment was to join the newly formed Decarbonization team and establish the scope and roadmap for this workstream. Our starting point was a common customer question:
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize-box">
                <div class="heading">"What is next after receiving my carbon footprint report?"</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                The core team included Laura (Sr. Product Manager), Jasper (Sr. Engineer), and myself (Sr. Product Designer). The Design Sprint also involved cross-functional stakeholders in collaborative workshops, including a Climate Scientist, Customer Support Manager, Carbon Accountant, and Data Analyst.
            </p>
            <p>
            The project ran for 5 days, with the following key milestones:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collect existing insights about customers and the market</li>
                <li>Identify past decarbonization efforts and pain points</li>
                <li>Focus the scope and prioritize a user problem to solve</li>
                <li>Run collaborative sessions to validate assumptions, test ideas, and generate sketches</li>
                <li>Develop a user flow and wireframes representing potential solutions</li>
                <li>Present results to leadership</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>Our team faced several challenges:</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="emphasize-box">

        <div class="col-md-12 mt-xl">
            <p>These challenges reflected Carbon Direct's broader aim of productizing deep scientific expertise and bespoke advisory solutions into a scalable SaaS platform. Successfully defining a Decarbonization roadmap could showcase how to achieve this while identifying the ideal customer profile for maximum impact.</p>

            <h2>Approach and Methodology</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>
                To rapidly align the team and leverage internal expertise under tight timelines, I adapted the Design Sprint to focus on the Understand, Sketch, and Decide phases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tailoring the Design Sprint allowed us to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather existing customer insights and identify past decarbonization efforts</li>
                <li>Focus on translating domain expertise into compelling platform features</li>
                <li>Accelerate the team's learning curve by engaging carbon science experts</li>
                <li>Make rapid decisions to move forward despite uncertainty</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I facilitated collaborative Miro workshops to map the problem space, sketch solutions, and define a roadmap. I also conducted individual interviews with cross-functional stakeholders to gather insights and validate assumptions.

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
                Our process centered around key activities:
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize-tag">Day one</div>
            <p>
            1. Collect insights about customers, competitors, market, and carbon management<br/>
            2. Identify user needs and pain points from past advisory services
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize-tag">Day two</div>
            <p>
            3. Translate knowledge into platform solutions aligned with user needs and scientific expertise<br/>
            4. Focus on a specific end goal and document other paths for future exploration
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize-tag">Day three</div>
            <p>
            5. Validate assumptions with cross-functional team using a problem map<br/>
            6. Create "How Might We" statements based on team feedback
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize-tag">Day four</div>
            <p>
            7. Sketch ideas, generate user flow, and craft wireframes
            </p>
            <div class="emphasize-tag">Day five</div>
            <p>
            8. Present final work to leadership
            </p>
            <p>
                I conducted stakeholder interviews, facilitated journey mapping, and led workshops to build understanding and alignment. We collaboratively mapped how different actors (customers, support, science advisors) would interact to deliver decarbonization insights. This map's feedback informed our "How Might We" statements for ideation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sketches were turned into wireframes and a user flow representing a 6-month roadmap, which were validated with stakeholders. Lack of clarity on the target customer and ambiguous direction forced us to proactively navigate ambiguity. We made clear decisions while documenting alternative paths.
