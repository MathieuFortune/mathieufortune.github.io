title: "Adapting a Design Sprint to rapidly deliver a product roadmap at Carbon Direct"
excerpt: |
  In this case study, I explore how I adapted and led a design sprint at Carbon Direct, a climate tech startup. Our goal was to tackle complex challenges and create a decarbonization roadmap for the company's carbon management platform. This project showcases my problem-solving approach, collaboration with cross-functional teams, and the customized methods I used to deliver impactful, user-centric solutions.

                <p>When I joined Carbon Direct's newly formed "Decarbonization team," we faced several challenges:</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">

                            <p>We lacked clarity on the ideal customer profile for this product area.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="emphasize-box">

                            <p>Our newly formed team consisted of just a Product Manager, an Engineer, and myself, with potential expansion contingent on uncovering new opportunities.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="emphasize-box">

                <p>Our primary objective was twofold:</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <div class="emphasize-box mono">Identify our customers' decarbonization-related needs and pain points</div>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="mt-2xl">Drawing from my decade of experience, I recognized that the Design Sprint process could be an effective tool to tackle the substantial challenge before us.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12 pt-lg">
                <h3>What is a Design Sprint?</h3>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>For those unfamiliar, a Design Sprint is a structured, five-day process that helps teams solve complex problems and validate ideas quickly. It involves phases like understanding the problem, sketching solutions, deciding on the best approach, prototyping, and testing with users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 pt-lg">
                <h3>Tailoring the Process</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Given our unique circumstances and time constraints, I adapted the traditional Design Sprint to focus on just the first three phases: Understand, Sketch, and Decide.</p>
                <p>This tailored approach allowed us to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex subject matter</li>
                    <li>Quickly identify potential roadmap items for our decarbonization workstream</li>
                    <li>Maximize team interaction, fostering team building in the process</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Initial Actions</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>One significant challenge we faced was the broad scope of our customers' decarbonization needs. To address this, I took a two-pronged approach.</p>
                <p>First, I gathered existing insights from within the organization. This included poring over interview data, analyzing competitor information, and reviewing market research. These sources provided a wealth of information to inform our process.</p>
                <p>Next, I collaborated closely with the Product Manager to run a prioritization exercise. We focused on identifying user pain points that would best serve both customer needs and business goals. This step was crucial in narrowing our focus and ensuring our efforts would have maximum impact.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>This groundwork led us to define a clear end goal for our users, which would guide our design sprint:</p>

            <div class="col-md-5">
                <p>To align stakeholders and integrate their expertise into the process, I utilized Miro, a collaborative whiteboard tool, to track progress and facilitate meaningful contributions.</p>
                <p>Throughout the week, I scheduled individual live sessions with stakeholders to learn about their workflows and capture their insights, followed by a group session to review the work and gather feedback.</p>
                <p>By involving this diverse group, we ensured that our solutions would be grounded in scientific accuracy, technical feasibility, and real customer needs.</p>
