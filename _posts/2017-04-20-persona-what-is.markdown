### General definition
First of all, it's necessary to know where the word persona comes from:

__Persona__

*- Latin -*
The mask of the actor in the theater.

*- psychanalysis -*
According to Carl Gustav Jung, psychic instance of adaptation of a human being to social norms. Offers the possibility for an individual to hide behind a socially rewarding mask and to hide its weaknesses.

In these two definitions we find the notion of a *"mask"* that we are wearing to pretend to be someone else.


### HMI design definition

In the area of ​​human-machine interface (HMI) design, it appears that digital projects are defined on a blurred user needs.
__These needs are perceived abstractly .__

The use of persona as users archetypes with their own personalities, stories, desires and specific needs allows the designer to "face" the user.

In HMI design, therefore, it's the __scenarisation of a user based on an ethnographic approach__ that is called persona.

### Benefits of the persona

To better understand what the person can bring to a project, let us look at its advantages:
The use of personas by designer involves different psychological principles.

__Empathy__ first, which corresponds to the ability to imagine the emotions and expectations of someone else until they feel as if they were her.

__Mind theory__, which consists in "putting yourself in the place of someone", which makes allow to anticipate actions and behavior of a user.

And finally, the __stereotypes theory__, which allows from real-world data to create pragmatic and instantiated simplifications of real users.

Moreover, this improves the __design creativity__. Indeed studies have shown (Brangier and Al. 2012) that personas used in system design improves the quantity and quality of generated ideas.

### To summarize

To summarize, a persona can be seen as a tool to facilitate future product interface or plateform design while remaining in line with the expectations and needs of customers/users.
