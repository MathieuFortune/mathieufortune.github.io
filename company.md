<h3 class="center"><em>"Sharing, Intellectual honesty, Transparency, Well being, Pragamatism and Trust"</em></h3>

I’ve been driven by these values by working for 7+ years as user experience designer and front-end developer both in agency and successful e-commerce start-up.

Today, I wish to share my experiences and knowledge to you as an <br/>__independant consultant.__

 I'm constantly exploring [lean approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean){:target="_blank"} and [agiles methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"}, expert with languages like HTML, Sass, Javascript, enjoying tools like Gulp, Webpack and CMS like Jekyll, Wordpress, Symfony.

I also enjoy to share my knowledge troughout learning sessions, conferences, meetups.
I'm attached to share my knowledge in web development and design in order to teach everyone wanting to be autonomous and experiencing new topics.

### What

During these past 7 years of activity, I have :

* <u>Worked directly with clients</u> in agency, defining project scopes, goals, assumptions and pain points ;

* <u>Builded fast responsive website</u> with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, responsive design and [opQuast good practices](http://www.opquast.com){:target="_blank"} ;

* <u>Created aesthetic user interfaces</u>, developed mockups and prototypes of systems for websites and applications ;

* <u>Accompanied marketing teams</u> in the development of their tools and their web skills ;

* <u>Redesigned huge e-commerce website</u> with iterative scrum and lean approach ;

* <u>Led usability testing</u> with user and took their feedbacks to improve designs ;

* And many more...

### Who

I can work with small or medium-size buisness, start-ups, design/dev teams, digital agencies, ...

At every stages of your product both in reflection and in realization :

__- Kick off of your project -__ Research, test of ideas, I can help you build the best suitable product for your users.

__- Project development -__ Need help during the development phase, I can deliver fast results by using agiles practices.

__- Product enhancement -__ Sustain, improve quality and performances of your exsisting product by helping your team develop their skills and helping develop key functionnalities.
