<h3 class="joker-fs center no-marg-v"><em>"Sharing, Intellectual Honesty, Transparency, Well-being, Pragmatism, and Trust"</em></h3>
<br>
Curiosity is my driving factor. I love absorbing new knowledge and mixing it with my existing understandings. I also love to share it with my colleagues.

I best perform in creative environments. Nothing energizes me like a deep brainstorming session.

I relish a good challenge and encountering new cultures, personally or professionally. I've traveled across three continents to meet hundreds of people. I've started a company and bootstrapped to profitability. I have a special admiration for those who always strive for open-mindedness and knowledge.

### What

During these past nine years of activity, I've :

* <u>Co-founded</u> a start-up in the online education. Generating 6 figure revenue in the span of 18 months ;

* <u>Worked directly with clients</u> in agencies, defining product scopes, goals, user's assumptions and pain points ;

* <u>Led product feature overall</u> on a multi-million dollar e-commerce marketplace ;

* <u>Built fast responsive website</u> with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, responsive design and Agile methods ;

* <u>Designed aesthetic user interfaces</u>, mockups and prototypes of systems for websites and mobile applications ;

* <u>Led user research</u> with a design thinking and lean approach ;

* <u>Launched hundreds of marketing campaigns </u> that generated customer fidelity and revenue growth ;

* And many more...

### Who

I strive in cross-functional teams where customer and stakeholder buy-in is essential to business success.

I can contribute at every stage of your product from concept to launch:

__- Product conception -__ Research, user/stakeholder interviews, brainstorm solutions, roadmapping, I can help you research and identify your customer needs.

__- Product development -__ Need help during the development phase? I can deliver fast results by using Agiles practices.

__- Product launch -__ Working with the marketing, legal, and PR team, I can fluently communicate with different departments to coordinate product launch.

__- Product enhancement -__ Sustain, improve your existing product's quality and performances by helping your team develop their skills and build critical functionalities.

#### _I'm ready to add value to any team looking for an experienced and polyvalent Product Manager._
