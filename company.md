This intellectual honesty is not just about finding immediate solutions but about gaining a deeper understanding of the nuances of each project. It’s essential for me and my team to share this value, as it cultivates a culture of growth, learning, and mutual respect.

Together, these values shape my approach to design and collaboration, ensuring that every project I undertake is both meaningful and impactful.

<blockquote class="small" style="max-width: 100%; margin: 16px;">
Don't wait on the chance to add Mathieu Fortune to your team!<br/>
I had the pleasure to work along side Mathieu at Mentor Collective for nearly 3 years -- Me in the role of Senior Product Manager, and him in the role of Senior Product Designer. When running a product squad, a designer can really make or break a team's flow, and I can say without a doubt that Mathieu was always a key player in allowing us to ship high quality product work, quickly! He has a gift for being able to envision the big picture (think 1-5year plan), and also be able to work with the team to break that work out iteratively, so we can be continuously shipping, learning, and improving.<br/><br/>
One of the ways Mathieu accomplished this while I worked with him, was via building out a reliable design system that not only supported our current product, but was able to grow and evolve as the product grew and evolved. The roll-out of this update was smooth and easy for the whole team to understand. <br/>
Additionally, Mathieu's documentation is pristine. In fact, on one occasion while I was reviewing Mathieu's Figma designs, my husband (a VP of Product at a startup) looked over my shoulder and said, "Whoa, did your designer do that?! I've never seen such an organized Figma file!" For Mathieu, design work doesn't stop at building out a UX/UI that solves the user problem -- He follows through to make sure he communicates this design out to the development team in order to turn the ideas into a reality. Clear layers, research documentation, handoff notes, and a background in frontend engineering makes Mathieu a dream designer for engineers. I lost count of the number of sprint retros where the engineers sang his praises.<br/>
<br/>
All of this, and I still haven't talked about:<br/>
1. The abundance of user research work Mathieu planned, conducted, neatly summarized, and shared with the team<br/>
2. The discovery and brainstorming activities he would regularly lead<br/>
3. The absolute pleasure it is just to work with somebody as kind, caring, and user focused as Mathieu <br/>
<br/>
Mathieu is hands down, one of the best designers I've had the pleasure to work with, and if you're lucky enough to add him to your team, I'm sure you'll feel the same way.

<blockquote class="small col-half--left">I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Mathieu on various projects at Carbon Direct. He’s an amazing Senior Product Designer and a fantastic collaborator, especially when it comes to creating products in the climate and sustainability space.
Mathieu's attention to detail and his knack for understanding what users need are top-notch. Despite being new to the climate and sustainability field, he quickly got up to speed and was engaging in detailed conversations with our climate scientists within weeks! He ensures every design is visually appealing, functional, and user-friendly. His ability to tackle complex user problems means our projects always succeed. <br/>
But Mathieu isn’t just a talented designer. His skills in product, engineering, and business strategy make him a huge asset for any team looking to build a 0-to-1 product. His strategic thinking and technical expertise have been crucial to our success. Plus, he’s excellent at aligning design and business goals seamlessly. I highly recommend Mathieu for any team needing a dedicated, skilled designer who loves to collaborate. He’s a real asset, and I’m confident he will continue to do amazing work in any field he contributes to.

<blockquote class="small col-half--left">Mathieu was a Senior Product Designer on my team at Mentor Collective. In his time at Mentor Collective, I came to rely upon him for his insightful questions and probing perspective. He championed the need for a more modern design system for our B2B and B2C applications. He took ownership of the design system's process, deliverables and even the maintenance. The look and feel of the Mentor Collective platform (and the ability to scale it up) is a direct result of Mathieu's efforts. Lastly, Mathieu is a designer who not just designs for what is needed now, but strives to anticipate the next set of needs. His research and design will not just meet your immediate needs but plants the seeds for future directions.

I was fortunate to work with Mathieu for over two years on the same product squad at Mentor Collective and can confidently recommend him as a talented designer. As a Senior Product Designer, his dedication to research and data-driven design ensured that user experiences were not only visually compelling but also highly effective. Threading this needle is not always easy! Mathieu’s attention to detail and creative solutions are standout qualities that consistently elevated his work. What sets Mathieu apart is his ability to be a creative thought partner when it comes to bridging the gap between design and engineering, demonstrating a commitment to collaboration and teamwork. He consistently engaged in productive dialogue with engineers to improve design handoff processes and sprint workflows, and excelled in finding innovative design workarounds to technical limitations, which makes him an invaluable asset to any project. When he joined Mentor Collective, Mathieu was faced with a design landscape that had long been without a dedicated designer. He approached the buffet of design needs with creativity and impressive resolve. Our excitement and gratitude that he joined our team only increased the longer he was there. One of his most impactful early contributions to the team was collaborating with engineering to establish a thoughtful design system, aligning it with branding while enhancing usability and accessibility across the platform. This new design system was quickly used to redesign a highly visible dashboard that had unique data and usability challenges, and saw a notable increase in visitor engagement after launch. And he was just getting started! Mathieu's abundant contributions undeniably left a positive and lasting impact on our projects and the team. Any team would be lucky to have him.

You want Mathieu on your team. I worked with him on multiple projects while at Mentor Collective, including the launch of a brand-new on-demand learning platform capable of scaling to support 1-million learners. Mathieu collaboratively engaged in research, ideation, and designs for the project. He was an incredibly valuable thought partner for the project, proving recommendations that created deeper value for users. He also took the time to teach me new skillsets (such as HTML).

I consider myself lucky to have closely worked with Mathieu for over two years on the same product team. In his role as a Senior Product Designer, he led many significant initiatives to design new features and revitalize core parts of our apps - taking on challenging projects involving processing large amounts of data and creating beautiful designs for data visualization.

Mathieu’s attention to detail, focus on accessibility and user research were essential factors that resulted in a great looking and intuitive product with many features seeing increased usage after his redesigns.

As an engineer, I was appreciative of Mathieu’s collaboration with engineers to create a design handoff process that enabled us to jump into implementation efficiently. With his background in frontend engineering his feedback was always organized and detailed, which enabled quick and smooth iteration.

In addition to his technical expertise, Mathieu is truly great to work with and brings enthusiasm, adaptability and care for the user’s experience that make him a valuable addition to any team.
