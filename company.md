Don't wait on the chance to add Mathieu Fortune to your team!<br/>
I had the pleasure to work along side Mathieu at Mentor Collective for nearly 3 years -- Me in the role of Senior Product Manager, and him in the role of Senior Product Designer. When running a product squad, a designer can really make or break a team's flow, and I can say without a doubt that Mathieu was always a key player in allowing us to ship high quality product work, quickly! He has a gift for being able to envision the big picture (think 1-5year plan), and also be able to work with the team to break that work out iteratively, so we can be continuously shipping, learning, and improving.<br/><br/>
One of the ways Mathieu accomplished this while I worked with him, was via building out a reliable design system that not only supported our current product, but was able to grow and evolve as the product grew and evolved. The roll-out of this update was smooth and easy for the whole team to understand. <br/>
Additionally, Mathieu's documentation is pristine. In fact, on one occasion while I was reviewing Mathieu's Figma designs, my husband (a VP of Product at a startup) looked over my shoulder and said, "Whoa, did your designer do that?! I've never seen such an organized Figma file!" For Mathieu, design work doesn't stop at building out a UX/UI that solves the user problem -- He follows through to make sure he communicates this design out to the development team in order to turn the ideas into a reality. Clear layers, research documentation, handoff notes, and a background in frontend engineering makes Mathieu a dream designer for engineers. I lost count of the number of sprint retros where the engineers sang his praises.<br/>
<br/>
All of this, and I still haven't talked about:<br/>
1. The abundance of user research work Mathieu planned, conducted, neatly summarized, and shared with the team<br/>
2. The discovery and brainstorming activities he would regularly lead<br/>
3. The absolute pleasure it is just to work with somebody as kind, caring, and user focused as Mathieu <br/>
<br/>
Mathieu is hands down, one of the best designers I've had the pleasure to work with, and if you're lucky enough to add him to your team, I'm sure you'll feel the same way.

<blockquote class="small col-half--left">Mathieu was a Senior Product Designer on my team at Mentor Collective. In his time at Mentor Collective, I came to rely upon him for his insightful questions and probing perspective. He championed the need for a more modern design system for our B2B and B2C applications. He took ownership of the design system's process, deliverables and even the maintenance. The look and feel of the Mentor Collective platform (and the ability to scale it up) is a direct result of Mathieu's efforts. Lastly, Mathieu is a designer who not just designs for what is needed now, but strives to anticipate the next set of needs. His research and design will not just meet your immediate needs but plants the seeds for future directions.

<blockquote class="small col-half--right">Mathieu would be a wonderful asset to any team and is one of the strongest product designers I've ever worked with. Having worked alongside him in the Research and Design team at Mentor Collective, I can attest to his wide range of design and technical expertise. He is empathetic, communicative, inquisitive and adaptable. He is great at giving/receiving feedback and always strives to improve his craft. I have no doubt he will be a great leader and teammate in any future team he joins. I hope to have the chance to work with him again in the near future!

One of my greatest sources of excitement in moving from a marketing role onto the Research and Design team was getting to work more closely with Mathieu. I had seen from a distance his dedication, attention to detail, and collaborative nature; all these qualities held up when we had the opportunity to work as a team. He is curious, diligent, and cares so deeply about the end user's needs. Mathieu is a genuine pleasure to work with, and any organization would be lucky to harness his thoughts and talents for their benefit.

Mathieu's designs and portfolio speak for themselves. 
My reason for recommending him is his talent for listening, inquiring, and processing information from others. Mathieu can take in novel information and turn it into something that makes everyone in the room better—better at communicating, better at their job, better at what they are trying to accomplish. He is an outstanding colleague and I am grateful for working with him.

<blockquote class="small col-half--left">I had the pleasure of working closely with Mathieu as a software engineer while he served as our Senior Product Designer. Mathieu is an exceptional talent who consistently delivers outstanding results. One of Mathieu's greatest strengths is his ability to think and deliver quickly. His agility in problem-solving is remarkable, allowing us to tackle complex projects with ease. What sets Mathieu apart is his background as a frontend engineer, providing valuable insights into the engineering aspects of user-centric projects. Mathieu's out-of-the-box thinking and solution-oriented mindset make him a valuable asset to any team. If you're looking for a talented and versatile Senior Product Designer who excels in both creativity and technical understanding, I highly recommend Mathieu.

I was fortunate to work with Mathieu for over two years on the same product squad at Mentor Collective and can confidently recommend him as a talented designer. As a Senior Product Designer, his dedication to research and data-driven design ensured that user experiences were not only visually compelling but also highly effective. Threading this needle is not always easy! Mathieu’s attention to detail and creative solutions are standout qualities that consistently elevated his work. What sets Mathieu apart is his ability to be a creative thought partner when it comes to bridging the gap between design and engineering, demonstrating a commitment to collaboration and teamwork. He consistently engaged in productive dialogue with engineers to improve design handoff processes and sprint workflows, and excelled in finding innovative design workarounds to technical limitations, which makes him an invaluable asset to any project. When he joined Mentor Collective, Mathieu was faced with a design landscape that had long been without a dedicated designer. He approached the buffet of design needs with creativity and impressive resolve. Our excitement and gratitude that he joined our team only increased the longer he was there. One of his most impactful early contributions to the team was collaborating with engineering to establish a thoughtful design system, aligning it with branding while enhancing usability and accessibility across the platform. This new design system was quickly used to redesign a highly visible dashboard that had unique data and usability challenges, and saw a notable increase in visitor engagement after launch. And he was just getting started! Mathieu's abundant contributions undeniably left a positive and lasting impact on our projects and the team. Any team would be lucky to have him.

You want Mathieu on your team. I worked with him on multiple projects while at Mentor Collective, including the launch of a brand-new on-demand learning platform capable of scaling to support 1-million learners. Mathieu collaboratively engaged in research, ideation, and designs for the project. He was an incredibly valuable thought partner for the project, proving recommendations that created deeper value for users. He also took the time to teach me new skillsets (such as HTML). His guidance, expertise, talent, and collaborative personality make him a true asset to any team. I hope to work with Mathieu again in the future!
