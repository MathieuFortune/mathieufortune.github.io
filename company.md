<h3 class="center"><em>"Sharing, Intellectual honesty, Transparency, Wellbeing, Pragmatism, and Trust"</em></h3>

I’ve been driven by these values while working for eight years as User eXperience Designer and Front-End Developer both in an agency, e-commerce start-up, and companies.

Today, I wish to share my experiences and knowledge to you as an <br/> __Product Manager__.

I’m continually exploring [lean approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean){:target="_blank"} and [agiles methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"}, expert with languages like HTML, CSS/Sass, Javascript, enjoying tools like Gulp, Webpack, CMS like Jekyll, Wordpress, Symfony and always exploring new design ideas.

I also enjoy sharing my knowledge throughout learning sessions, conferences, and meetups. 

I’m attached to share my expertise in design, web development to teach everyone wanting to be autonomous and seeking to experience new topics.

### What

* <u>Worked directly with clients</u> in an agency, defining project scopes, goals, assumptions and pain points ;
