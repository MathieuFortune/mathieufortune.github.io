#### _"Sharing, Intellectual honesty, Transparency, Well being, Pragamatism and Trust"_

I’ve been driven by these values by working for 5+ years as front-end developer and user experience designer both in agency and successful e-commerce start-up.

 I'm constantly exploring [lean approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean){:target="_blank"} and [agiles methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development){:target="_blank"}, familliar with languages like HTML, Sass, Javascript, enjoying tools like Gulp, Webpack and CMS like Jekyll, Wordpress, Symfony.

I also enjoy to share my knowledge troughout learning sessions, conferences, meetups.
I'm attached to share my knowledge in web development and design in order to teach everyone wanting to be autonomous and experiencing new topics.

### What

During these past 5 years of activity, I have :

* Worked directly with clients in agency, defining project scopes, goals, assumptions and pain points ;
* Builded fast responsive website with HTML5, CSS, Javascript, responsive design and performance ;
* Created aesthetic user interfaces, developed mockups of systems for websites and applications ;
* Accompanied marketing teams in the development of their tools and their web skills ;
* Redesigned huge e-commerce website with iterative scrum and lean approach ;
* Led usability testing with user and employ their feedbacks to improve designs ;
* And many more...

### Who

I can work with small or medium-size buisness, start-ups, design/dev teams, digital agencies, ...
